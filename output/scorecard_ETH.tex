\begin{itemize}
\item
  In Ethiopia the productivity as a future worker of a child born today
  is \textbf{38 percent} as much as it could be. The HCI has three
  components: survival to age 5, health, and education. For more
  information on human capital outcomes and the HCI, please see the
  country two-pager on
  \textcolor{bondiblue}{\textbf{www.worldbank.org/humancapitalproject}}
\item
  \textbf{Social Protection Coverage} In Ethiopia\textbf{13 percent} of
  the population is covered by social safety net programs. This is lower
  than both the average for its region (23) and the average for its
  income group (17).
\item
  \textbf{Open Defecation.} In Ethiopia, data on the percentage of the
  population that practices open defecation do not exist. The average
  for the country's region is 25 percent and for its income group is 25
  percent.

  its income group (28).
\item
  \textbf{Women, Business and the Law Index.} This index measures gender
  inequality in the law and identifies barriers to women's economic
  participation, and a larger value shows higher gender equity.In
  Ethiopia, the value is \textbf{72} out of 100. This is higher than
  both the average for its region (70) and the average for its income
  group (68).
\item
  \textbf{Net Enrolment Rate in Secondary School.} In Ethiopia,
  \textbf{30 percent} of women of secondary-school age are enroled in
  school. This is lower than the average for its region (35) but higher
  than the average for its income group (29).

The present scorecard aims to be a conversation starter on some of the
main indicators that show progress towards human capital outcomes. The
list of indicators presented here is not exhaustive and should be
complemented with more specific variables. ~

The sources for the different indicators come from the Human Capital
Project, the World Development Indicators, and the World Bank's internal
system to monitor investments. ~
