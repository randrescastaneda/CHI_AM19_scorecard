This scorecard presents a snapshot of the country's commitment to the
human capital agenda and presents information on how the World Bank
Group is supporting the government in the social sectors.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Human Capital Index.} In Ethiopia the productivity as a future
  worker of a child born today is \textbf{38 percent} as much as it
  could be. The HCI has three components: survival to age 5, health, and
  education. For more information on human capital outcomes and the HCI,
  please see the country two-pager on
  \textcolor{bondiblue}{\textbf{www.worldbank.org/humancapitalproject}}
\item
  \textbf{Adolescent Fertility Rate.} In Ethiopia, there are \textbf{62
  births} per 1,000 women ages 15-19. This is lower than the Africa
  Human Capital Target for 2023 (83).
\item
  \textbf{Social Protection Coverage.} In Ethiopia, \textbf{13 percent}
  of the population is covered by social safety net programs. This is
  lower than the Africa Human Capital Target for 2023 (30).
\item
  \textbf{Open Defecation.} In Ethiopia, \textbf{27 percent} of the
  population practices open defecation. This is higher than the Africa
  Human Capital Target for 2023 (15).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Total Fertility Rate.} In Ethiopia, the total fertility rate
  is \textbf{4.1}. This is lower than both the average for its region
  (4.5) and the average for its income group (4.7).
\item
  \textbf{Contraceptive Prevalence.} In Ethiopia, \textbf{37 percent} of
  women ages 15-49 uses some form of contraceptive method. This is
  higher than both the average for its region (31) and the average for
  its income group (28).
\item
  \textbf{Women, Business and the Law Index.} This index measures gender
  inequality in the law and identifies barriers to women's economic
  participation, and a larger value shows higher gender equity. In
  Ethiopia, the value is \textbf{72} out of 100. This is higher than
  both the average for its region (70) and the average for its income
  group (68).
\item
  \textbf{Net Enrolment Rate in Secondary School.} In Ethiopia,
  \textbf{30 percent} of girls of secondary-school age are enroled in
  secondary school. This is lower than the average for its region (35)
  but higher than the average for its income group (29).

Ethiopia is part of a network of countries committed to the Human
Capital agenda.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Health Spending.} Ethiopia spends \textbf{6 percent} of its
  government budget on health. This is lower than both the regional
  average (7.6) and the average for its income group (6.8).
\item
  \textbf{Education Spending.} Ethiopia spends \textbf{27.1 percent} of
  its government budget on education. This is higher than both the
  regional average (15.3) and the average for its income group (15.5).
\item
  \textbf{Social Protection Spending.} Ethiopia spends \textbf{10.8
  percent} of its government budget on social protection. This is higher
  than both the regional average (9.9) and the average for its income
  group (10.8).

  \textbf{Building Human Capital.} The Country Policy and Institutional
  Assesment rating for building human resources in Ethiopia is
  \textbf{4.5} (1 is low and 6 is high). This is higher than both the
  regional average (3.5) and the average for its income group (3.5).
  This indicator assesses the national policies and public and private
  sector service delivery that affect access to and quality of health
  and education services.
\item
  \textbf{Identification} In Ethiopia, \textbf{64.5 percent} of the
  population does not have proof of identity. This is higher than both
  the regional average (33.8) and the average for its income group
  (34.6).
\item
  \textbf{Statistical Data on Human Capital} In Ethiopia, the latest
  available data on stunting rates is from 2016. Similarly, the last
  available data point on Harmonized Learning Outcomes is from 2010.

This scorecard is intended to be a conversation starter on where a
country is on various aspects of human capital development and the state
of the World Bank's support in the social sectors. The list of
indicators presented here is not exhaustive and should be complemented
with more specific variables. Most of the indicators are related to the
Africa Human Capital Plan. ~

The sources of data for the different indicators include: the Human
Capital Project, the World Development Indicators, and the World Bank's
internal system to monitor investments. ~
